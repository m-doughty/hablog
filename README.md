How to write a new post?
========================

1. All posts must go under the `/_posts/` directory
2. The file name of each post must be `yyyy-mm-dd-<file-name-seperated-by-dashes>.md`
3. The content of the post must correspond to a specific structure

## A Post's Structure

```markdown
title: <the title of the post>
authors: <the author of the post, seperated, by, commas>
tags: <tags for the post, separated, by, commas>

[...blank line...]

<The rest of the post in Markdown format>
```
