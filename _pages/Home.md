# The Fine Line

## About Me

I'm Matt, I've been a software engineer since 2013, starting out with OOP languages like Java and PHP before making
the jump to the functional paradigm. I consider myself a 
[polyglot](https://blog.lelonek.me/be-a-polyglot-programmer-6e7423916ed8), a 
[remote-first evangelist](https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/02/08/means-remote-first-company/), and a
[classical liberal](https://mises.org/library/what-classical-liberalism). For my sins, I'm also a Luton Town fan.

## About The Blog

The name, *The Fine Line*, is taken from the famous quote from Oscar Levant: "There's a fine line between genius and
madness." I feel like this blog will be walking the line a lot over the next few months, so it seemed like a fitting
title. That and the `.io` wasn't taken.

The blog runs on my fork of [hablog](https://github.com/m-doughty/hablog), a simple Haskell application which builds
blogs from Markdown, is built on [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/m-doughty/hablog), and runs on a
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) Hobby instance. It took me about five hours to set up, but that was mostly my lack
of knowledge of the build tools.

The blog is likely to cover functional programming (obviously), along with the tech industry, some politics and a
smidge of current events. I'll try to keep the tags accurate so you'll be able to filter the posts you're interested in.
