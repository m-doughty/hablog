# Resume

I'm an experienced polyglot developer with a belief that language and tooling are implementation details 
and should be picked based on desired results. I've worked with technologies as diverse as Elixir, 
Java, PHP, MySQL, Postgres, NoSQL, Azure and GCP for clients in the government sector, established 
financial giants, scale-ups, and first year startups. My interest is in solving problems, and I make 
sure to keep a wide toolbox so that I can approach everything with the best tool available for the job.

Technology isn't just a job for me, it's a passion. It's a higher order of tool which we use to shape 
the future, removing obstacles to publishing & journalism, international payments, artistic expression, 
communication, and transportation. You'll often find me learning new languages or building personal 
projects (far too few of which I open source) in order to explore new ways to tackle old obstacles.

If your organization needs an engineer with a dearth of experience, a drive to forge the next generation
of customer interactions, and an interest in technology which goes deeper than turning up and getting a 
paycheck, get in contact.
